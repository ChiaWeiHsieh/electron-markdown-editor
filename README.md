## Project Structure

The structure of this project is very similar to the structure of a monorepo.

The entire source code of the program is divided into three modules (packages) that are bundled each independently:
- [`packages/main`](packages/main)
Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
- [`packages/preload`](packages/preload)
Used in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences.preload`. See [Checklist: Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
- [`packages/renderer`](packages/renderer)
Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page).

### Build web resources

Packages `main` and `preload` are built in [library mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode) as it is a simple javascript.
`renderer` package build as regular web app.

The build of web resources is performed in the [`scripts/build.js`](scripts/build.js). Its analogue is a sequential call to `vite build` for each package.

### Compile App
Next step is run  packaging and compilation a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux with "auto update" support out of the box. 

To do this, using the [electron-builder]:
- In npm script `compile`: This script is configured to compile the application as quickly as possible. It is not ready for distribution, is compiled only for the current platform and is used for debugging.
- In GitHub Action: The application is compiled for any platform and ready-to-distribute files are automatically added to the draft GitHub release.
